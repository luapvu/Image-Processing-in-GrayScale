Image-Processing-in-GrayScale

This project allows users to read in two coloured images of the same MxN ratio. The images are converted into gray scale and subtracted from one another. The images are then written to a jpeg file.

To run this script call main.m in matlab, you can add your own images in to explore or run off my images provided.
